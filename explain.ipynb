    "### Troubleshooting Environment Setup: Missing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter `ImportError` messages or other package-related issues after creating the Conda environment (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError`), it's likely that one or more packages failed to install correctly during the initial environment creation process. This can sometimes happen due to network issues, conflicts, or specific system configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To resolve this, manually install the problematic package(s) using `pip`, ensuring you specify the exact version listed in the `environment.yaml` file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Activate your Conda environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda activate your_env_name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (Replace `your_env_name` with the actual name of your Conda environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identify the missing package and its version:**\n",
    "    Refer to your `environment.yaml` file. Locate the `pip` section or the main `dependencies` list. For example, if you see an error related to `torch`, find its entry:\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    # ... other dependencies\n",
    "    dependencies:\n",
    "      - python=3.9\n",
    "      - pip\n",
    "      - pip:\n",
    "        - torch==1.10.0+cu113 # Example entry\n",
    "        - transformers==4.12.0 # Another example\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Manually install the package with pip:**\n",
    "    Use the `pip install` command, appending `==` and the exact version number you found in the `environment.yaml`.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install package_name==x.y.z\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113\n",
    "    pip install transformers==4.12.0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Repeat this for any other packages causing import errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This manual installation typically resolves issues where Conda's solver or initial pip installations within the Conda creation process might have failed for specific packages."

We just want some way to get our ATC codes in here\n",

    "## 4. Initializing Encoding Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines the process of building our model's vocabulary, analogous to the tokenization phase in traditional NLP. ExMed-BERT handles patient data across five distinct \"modes\" or sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Code Sequence:** Medical codes (e.g., ICD, CPT, RxNorm, ATC).\n",
    "2.  **Sex Sequence:** Patient sex/gender information (though currently omitted from our model).\n",
    "3.  **State Sequence:** US state information (though currently omitted from our model).\n",
    "4.  **Age Sequence:** Patient age information.\n",
    "5.  **Visit Sequence:** This sequence is implicitly generated by ordering patient events based on their respective dates. (NO PYTHON CLASS FOR THIS MODE)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these modalities, we employ dedicated dictionary classes, each responsible for managing its own vocabulary. This ensures that vocabularies are kept separate and distinct across modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integer Mapping:** During this initialization, each unique medical code (or other data point) is mapped to a distinct integer ID. This integer serves as a unique identifier, or \"token,\" for that specific data element within the model.\n",
    "* **Learned Embeddings:** Later in the model's architecture, each of these unique tokens will be assigned its own learnable embedding, allowing the model to capture semantic relationships and context.\n",
    "* **Reserved Tokens:** The first six integer IDs are reserved for BERT's special tokens, defined as `DICT_DEFAULTS = [\"PAD\", \"UNK\", \"CLS\", \"SEP\", \"MASK\", \"NA\"]`. These special tokens serve various purposes, such as padding sequences to a uniform length (`PAD`), handling unknown tokens (`UNK`), marking the beginning of a sequence (`CLS`), separating segments (`SEP`), masking tokens for pre-training (`MASK`), and indicating not applicable data (`NA`).\n",
    "* **Modality-Specific Vocabularies:** To reiterate, the vocabularies are __*not*__ mixed together. Each dictionary class maintains a separate set of vocabulary and mappings for its respective modality, allowing ExMed-BERT to process and learn from these distinct data types independently yet cohesively within the model's architecture.\n"

    "* **Birth Year:** The patient's year of birth.\n",

    "\n",
    "While \"Prolonged Length of Stay\" (PLOS) is a significant clinical outcome, it is generally **not used during the pre-training phase** of ExMed-BERT. Pre-training typically focuses on learning general representations from large volumes of unlabeled medical text and codes. However, PLOS could serve as an excellent **downstream fine-tuning task**, where the pre-trained ExMed-BERT model is further trained on a labeled dataset to predict whether a patient will experience a prolonged hospital stay. This leverages the learned medical knowledge for a specific clinical prediction problem."

    "## 6. Patient Object: Encoding and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Patient` class is central to preparing raw patient data for the model. It handles the encoding of various data points using predefined dictionaries (like `CodeDict`, `SexDict`, `AgeDict`, `StateDict`), and orchestrates critical preprocessing steps such as masking for Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and sequence truncation/padding. Essentially, it transforms a patient's raw medical record into a structured, numerical format that can be directly fed into a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class manages patient data, incorporates vocabulary definitions, and applies various configurable model parameters to construct the input sequences. The examples below show the patient sequence *after* masking has been performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some important parameters and outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patient Class Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`max_length`**: Defines the maximum number of codes (or patient events) allowed in the sequence. Sequences longer than this will be truncated, and shorter ones will be padded.\n",
    "* **`mask_drugs`**: A boolean flag that, when `True`, enables the masking of drug codes during the MLM pre-training task. This allows the model to learn to predict drug codes from their context. This can be extended to other code types if desired.\n",
    "* **`drop_duplicates`**: When set to `True` (recommended), this parameter ensures that only unique codes occurring on the exact same `time_point` (date) are retained, preventing redundancy in concurrent events.\n",
    "* **`converted_codes`**: This boolean flag indicates whether the input diagnosis and drug codes provided to the `Patient` object have already been converted to their target format (e.g., PheWAS, ATC).\n",
    "    * If `True`, the class skips its internal conversion functions, assuming codes are pre-processed.\n",
    "    * If `False`, it signals that input codes may require transformation based on `convert_icd_to_phewas` and `convert_rxcui_to_atc` flags.\n",
    "* **`convert_icd_to_phewas`**: When `True` (and `converted_codes` is `False`), ICD diagnosis codes will be mapped to PheWAS codes during processing. If `False`, ICD codes remain as-is.\n",
    "* **`convert_rxcui_to_atc`**: When `True` (and `converted_codes` is `False`), RxCUI drug codes will be transformed into ATC codes. If `False`, RxCUI codes remain in their original format.\n",
    "* **`dynamic_masking`**: Setting this to `True` is recommended as it ensures that different codes are masked on each iteration (or epoch). This prevents the model from memorizing a fixed set of masked tokens and improves generalization.\n",
    "* **`age_usage`**: Specifies the unit for age representation (e.g., \"year\", \"months\", \"decimal\"). This aligns with how age values are defined in the `AgeDict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Input Modalities (from `patient.get_patient_data()`):\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing and processing a `Patient` object, calling `model_input = patient.get_patient_data()` retrieves a dictionary containing various sequences (modalities) ready for model consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`input_ids`**: A tensor or list containing the numerical IDs of the PheWAS and ATC codes in the patient's sequence. Special reserved BERT tokens (`0-5`) are used for specific purposes (e.g., `[CLS]`, `[MASK]`, `[PAD]`). You will see many `0`s at the end of sequences, which are `PAD` tokens used to ensure all patient sequences conform to the `max_length`.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([ 2, 31, 32, 33, 34, 4, 36, 37, 9, 10, 11, 12, 32, 15, 16, 0, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `['CLS', '715.2', '272.1', '585.3', '800', 'MASK', '1000', '1100', 'D05AX02', 'E03AA01', 'F01BA01', 'G04BE03', '272.1', 'K01AA02', 'L01XE01', 'PAD', ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`entity_ids`**: A tensor indicating the type of `input_id` code at each index. This helps the model differentiate between code categories.\n",
    "    * `default`: Used for special BERT tokens (e.g., `[CLS]`, `[PAD]`).\n",
    "    * `atc`: Denotes an ATC (drug) code.\n",
    "    * `phewas`: Denotes a PheWAS (diagnosis) code.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `['default', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'phewas', 'atc', 'atc', 'atc', 'atc', 'atc', 'atc', 'atc', 'default', ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`sex_ids`**: A tensor representing the patient's biological sex, constant across all active tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `['MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'MALE', 'PAD', ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`state_ids`**: A tensor holding the patient's state of residence, constant across all active tokens.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 0, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `['OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'OR', 'PAD', ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`age_ids`**: A tensor representing the patient's age (often binned or quantized), constant across all active tokens.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 0, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `['28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', '28', 'PAD', ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`attention_mask`**: A critical tensor for transformer models, indicating which parts of the input sequence are \"real\" data and which are padding.\n",
    "    * `1`: Indicates an active, non-padded token that the model should attend to.\n",
    "    * `0`: Indicates a padded token that the model should ignore during attention calculations.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...])`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`position_ids`**: This tensor provides positional information to the model, enabling it to understand the chronological order of events within the sequence.\n",
    "    * If two or more medical events share the same `position_id`, it indicates that they occurred on the same day or within the same visit.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([ 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 0, ...])`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`code_labels`**: This tensor is specifically used for the Masked Language Model (MLM) pre-training task. It holds the *original IDs* of the tokens that were masked in `input_ids`.\n",
    "    * `-100`: This is a common convention in PyTorch to signify that a particular position should be ignored when calculating the loss (i.e., this token was not masked, or it's a special token that shouldn't be predicted).\n",
    "    * For example, if `input_ids` has `4` (the `[MASK]` token) at index 5, then `code_labels` at index 5 will contain the original numerical ID of the code that was masked (e.g., `35`, which decodes to `'900'`). If a token was replaced by a *random* token from the vocabulary (another part of BERT's masking strategy), `code_labels` will hold the ID of the *original* token before the replacement.\n",
    "    * **Example from data:** `tensor([-100, -100, -100, -100, -100, 35, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, 14, -100, -100, -100, ...])`\n",
    "    * **Decoded Example:** `[None, None, None, None, None, '900', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'J01CA04', None, None, None, ...]` (where `J01CA04` was the original value at that position before replacement/masking)."
